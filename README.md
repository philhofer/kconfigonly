# kconfigonly

This repo contains scripts to extract _just_ the Linux kernel
configuration files from a release. (I wanted to be able to
generate kernel configurations without the whole source
tree present.)

I've left `streamline_config.pl` in the archive for
generating configs based on the currently loaded modules.
